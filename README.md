# Interactive-Dashboard-with-D3.js-HOW-SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS-AFFECT-THE-CASES-OF-INFECTIOUS-DISEASE

Infectious diseases are diseases caused by organisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites.
These diseases may spread like wildfire because of human transmission, insect transmission and
the environment like water or air. Meanwhile, California is the most populous state in the United
States, which has a whopping 39 million people as of the 2020 census. It also has the largest
GDP in the United States and is the largest sub-national economy in the world. It has a gross
state product of $3.2 trillion as of 2019. If California is a country, it will become the 5th largest
economy in the world.

In this project, we visualized the analysis of infectious diseases that had happened in California
from 2000 to 2018. We would like to investigate how different socioeconomic factors like sex,
GDP, and population will affect the transmission of these diseases. We have two different
dashboards that focus on different aspects. The main focus of the first dashboard is to find out the
severity of different infectious diseases and information on a specific disease in every county in
California. In the second dashboard, several charts will be displayed to study and analyze the
effect of socioeconomic factors such as sex, GDP, and population on the number of cases of
diseases in the county.
